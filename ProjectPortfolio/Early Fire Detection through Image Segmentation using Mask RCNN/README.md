# Project Title: Early Fire Detection through Image Segmentation using Mask RCNN

## Overview:
The project focuses on early fire detection leveraging image segmentation techniques with the Mask RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model. By analyzing RGB images and extracting fire pixels, the system aims to accurately identify and localize areas of fire in various environments, such as forests, buildings, and houses. The primary goal is to provide timely detection of fire outbreaks, enabling prompt response and mitigation measures to prevent loss of life and property.

## Objective:
The main objective is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting and localizing fire in images. This involves building a robust image segmentation pipeline using Mask RCNN to predict masks and bounding boxes around the areas of interest, i.e., the fire. The ultimate aim is to provide authorities and emergency services with a reliable tool for early fire detection and response.

## Tools:
- Language: Python
- Libraries: numpy, keras, tensorflow, mrcnn, scikit-image

## Implementation:
1. Data Annotation: Utilize the VGG Annotator to create annotations marking regions of interest (fire) in the images.
2. Dataset Preparation: Load and preprocess image data along with annotations for training and validation.
3. Model Configuration: Define configurations for training the Mask RCNN model on the dataset.
4. Model Training: Train the Mask RCNN model over the annotated images to learn to detect fire.
5. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained model using metrics like precision, recall, and IoU (Intersection over Union).
6. Inference: Deploy the trained model to make predictions over test images, detecting and localizing fire instances.
7. Visualization: Visualize the predictions by overlaying bounding boxes and masks on the test images using matplotlib.
