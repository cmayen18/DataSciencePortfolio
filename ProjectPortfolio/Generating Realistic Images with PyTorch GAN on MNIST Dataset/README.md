# Project Title: Generating Realistic Images with PyTorch GAN on MNIST Dataset

## Overview:
The project focuses on understanding and implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch on the MNIST dataset. GANs are powerful tools for generating photorealistic images, which can be used for various applications like image-to-image translation and creating synthetic data. Through this project, we delve into the theory behind GANs, build and train GAN models, and generate realistic images of handwritten digits.
