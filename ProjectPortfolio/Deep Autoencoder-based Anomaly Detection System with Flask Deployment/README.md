# Project Title: Deep Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection System with Flask Deployment

## Overview:
The project focuses on utilizing deep autoencoders, a type of neural network architecture, for anomaly detection in transactional data. By leveraging autoencoders, the system learns to reconstruct normal transaction patterns and identifies anomalies based on deviations from the learned representations. Additionally, the model is deployed as an API endpoint using Flask, allowing real-time anomaly detection on incoming data.

## Objective:
The main objective is to develop an efficient anomaly detection system using deep autoencoders to detect unusual patterns or outliers in transactional data. This involves understanding the theory behind autoencoders, building and tuning the model using Keras and TensorFlow, and deploying it as a web service using Flask.

## Tools:
- Language: Python
- Packages: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, TensorFlow
- API service: Flask, Gunicorn

## Implementation:
1. **Understanding Business Objective**: Identify the need for anomaly detection in transactional data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the structure and characteristics of the transaction dataset.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and clean the data, handle missing values using imputation techniques.
4. **Autoencoder Theory**: Understand the concept, architecture, and working principles of autoencoders.
5. **Model Building**: Construct a base autoencoder model using Keras and TensorFlow.
6. **Model Tuning**: Fine-tune the autoencoder model to improve performance in detecting anomalies.
7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as an API endpoint using Flask.
