# Project Title: Predicting Shipment Modes in the Transport Industry: A Multilabel Classification Analysis

## Overview:
The project delves into the realm of transport logistics, aiming to optimize the mode of transport for each shipment. By employing machine learning techniques, specifically multilabel classification, the project seeks to predict the appropriate mode of transport considering various factors like product characteristics and logistical requirements. Four distinct approaches to multilabel classification are explored and compared for their effectiveness in solving the task. Leveraging Python along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and tensorflow, the project encompasses data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Objective:
The primary objective is to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately predicting the most suitable mode of transport for each shipment. By doing so, businesses can enhance their logistics operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency and customer satisfaction in the transport industry.

## Tools:
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, Google BigQuery

## Implementation:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understanding features
   - Checking data summary
   - Handling missing or invalid values
2. **Preprocessing**:
